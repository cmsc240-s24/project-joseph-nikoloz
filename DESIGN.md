# Project Design Document

## Introduction
The barAPI will allow the user to visit bars, talk with the bartenders, and enjoy different refreshments(version 2.0:travel to new locations for new types of bars and consumables).

## Background/Context
This API is for fun, and can also allow the user to learn about various drinks and foods.

## Stakeholders
Anyone interested in choose-your-adventure- type of games will enjoy this experience. I think the biggest attraction to this API would be the conversational easter-eggs hidden around the game. The easter eggs are spread around via bartender responses.
