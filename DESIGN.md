# Project Design Document

## Introduction
The API will allow the user to visit bars, talk with the bartenders, enjoy different refreshments, and travel to new locations for new types of bars and consumables. 

## Background/Context
This API is for fun, and can also allow the user to learn about various drinks and foods.

## Stakeholders
Anyone interested in choose-your-adventure- type of games will enjoy this experience. I think the biggest attraction to this API would be the conversational easter-eggs hidden around the game.

## Functional Requirements


## Use Case Description
